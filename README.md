# Data_Driven_Portfolio
The primary objective of this project is to develop and apply quantitative investment strategies for constructing an optimal portfolio from a universe of 110 assets, which includes 50 stocks, 50 ETFs, and 10 cryptocurrencies. These strategies yield a matrix representing the weightage of each asset. Additionally, the model predicts the probability of each asset ranking within a specific quintile based on its anticipated performance.

This project is undertaken as part of IEOR 4576: Data Driven Methods in Finance at Columbia University.

The repository will see periodic updates, reflecting enhancements and adjustments to the fundamental, technical, and alternative factors.
